This Python script checks if the International Space Station (ISS) is currently overhead based on a specified location and if it is nighttime at that location. It uses the ISS Position API and Sunrise-Sunset API to gather real-time data and determine if the ISS is visible in the night sky.

Features:
1) Location Configuration: Set your latitude and longitude to personalize your location.
2) ISS Position Check: Determines if the ISS is within a 5-degree radius of your location.
3) Nighttime Verification: Checks if the current time is before sunrise or after sunset to ensure visibility.
4) Scheduled Checks: Runs every 60 seconds to provide continuous updates
